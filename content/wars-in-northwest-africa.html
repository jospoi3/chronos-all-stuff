<p>In 146 BC, the Romans conquered the Punic city of Carthage (situated near today's Tunis) and renamed it Africa, a name that would eventually be given to the surrounding province. The city became a centre of Christian faith and economic trade: situated at one end of the Trans-Saharan Trade Network, it received goods from West Africa, mostly gold, ivory, and slaves.</p>

<p>In AD 711, the Arab conquerers regained control of North Africa and started to convert its population to Islam. Three centuries after this cultural shift, Muslim North Africans launched holy wars on non-Islamic West African kingdoms like Ghana. To develop their newly acquired land, the Muslims conquered and enslaved African peoples. The slaves consisted mainly of prisoners of war, who were eventually converted to Islam by their masters. 
After West Africa's conversion to Islam, regular routes were developed in the Trans-Saharan Trade Network.  Apart from resources like gold and salt, slaves were also traded. Women were sent to North Africa to live in harems or to be domestic workers; men were sold as soldiers or manual workers in West Africa.</p>
